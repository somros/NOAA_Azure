# Function to pull biomass proportion in AK over the model domain from out.nc files
# This is needed because we want to plot global T3 groundfish yield against the OY cap, but the OY cap is AK only
# We do not have spatial output for catch (because we save only some output from the large batch runs)

# Why does this work? Because mFC extracts catch proportionally to biomass and there are no further limitations to fishing
# See scripts comparing_biom_catch_spatial.R and check_catch_outputs.R for details on why this works
# Whn we diverge from this simple setup of no fleets, no spatial closures, and mFC, then this will no longer apply

# This function will:
# open an out.nc file for each of the MS runs
# pull WAA and NAA from nc file
# get biomass per cell
# collapse over depth
# filter to only selected age classes
# get proportions per box over the total for the selected biomass
# sum up over AK boxes
# average for the last 5 years (for consistency with how catch is being handled)
# return one scalar per group per run
